====

 Software framework for running and analyzing jobs/tests targeting HPC systems.

 Goals include:
   - Support multiple schedulers/resource managers 
   - Very modular to encourage collaboration  
   - simple to add tests, but highly configurable
   - Backward compatible (where reasonable) to the Gazebo test framework
   - Development adheres to a well know set of developemnt and coding principles.
   - Open source and managed thru git  
   - No extra glue files necessary to place into test/job directory
   - Only one command needed to run cli 
   - System config file and master config file separate, unlike one combined in Gazebo
