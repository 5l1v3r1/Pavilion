   - Independant of resource manager 
   - Very modular to encourage collaboration  
   - simple to add tests
   - Backward compatible (where reasonable) to the Gazebo test framework
   - Development adheres to a well know set of developemnt and coding principles.
   - Open source and managed thru git
