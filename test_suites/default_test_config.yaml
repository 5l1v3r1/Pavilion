# YAML        

#   Default test configuration file, vers. 0.2 

# NOTE - all CAPS variable are env vars

#    All entires can be re-defined by a users test config
#    file (found in PV_HOME/test_conf) with defaults inherited
#    from this file.
#    In theory, the entire default file can be used, but we recommend
#    making a copy, editing at least the name, location, and
#    runcmd sub-elements and removing everything else you don't need.
#

# for YAML formatting issues try: http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com
    
#    All values are available through:
#     -   YamlTestConfig class interface 

 
# A new named stanza is needed for each new test,
# but you only need to change what is different from the default config file

# Each test/job stanza will result in ONE log directory 
  

# UNIQUE test/job identifier. Any string will do.

  # Working space section

  # Results section

    # The test handler places all results under this directory.

    # <result> fail" to determine if the test passed or failed.

    # Trend Data matching pattern
    # the test handler will try to match "<td> name value units"
    # to discover any special result data  (a.k.a - trend data).
    # The "units" field is optional.
    trend_data_regex: <td>\s+(.*)

    # Script called at the end of the job. By default, the test harness requires
    # a "<result>" entry in the job output log file at the beginning of a line
    # followed by a pass or fail. Of course, there are many ways to accomplish this,
    # but if it's not done by the job itself this may be a convient way to add
    # this entry.
    # If defined here and executable, call...

    ##### TO BE MOVED TO "generic" config file!
    # Script that contains the logic that examines the job log 
    # to see if the test passed or failed.  chk_pf reports
    # a fail if there are any "fail" matches with the
    # pass_fail_regex, OR it can report pass if at least one "pass"
    # is matched with the regex, otherwise unknown is reported.
