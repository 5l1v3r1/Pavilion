Pavilion HPC Testing Framework 

  Abstract


  High Performance Computing clusters require a diverse set of methods to verify that they meet their intended 
performance, stability, and functional design objectives.  One method, testing, takes place over the entire life-cycle of a system 
with an emphasis on testing before, and after it's shipped to the customer and after significant system changes.
To efficiently use a set of tests that may have very different setup, user interface, and result footprints
a framework is needed that can control and bundle all these tests and quickly produce a common set of interpretable results. 
  This software, called Pavilion, is such a framework. Many of its underlying ideas come from a prior framework
developed at LANL between 2007 and 2013. Lessons learned, new feature requests that the old framework couldn't employ, and other
adaptable good ideas are all embodied into this new framework.  Two principle components that are forefront in Pavilion's 
design are the ability to support schedulers other than just Moab and a structure that lends itself to team collaboration.
The framework itself does not contain any specific tests, but is a mechanism for running and creative analysis of the
output data of any set of incorporated tests.
