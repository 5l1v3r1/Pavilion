Pavilion HPC Testing Framework 

  Abstract


  High Performance Computing clusters require a diverse set of tests to verify that the target system meets its 
designed performance, stability, and correctness objectives.  This testing takes place over the whole lifecycle of a system 
with an emphasis on testing before and after it's shipped to the customer and after significant system changes take place
during production. To efficiently use a set of tests that may have very different setup, command-line, and result footprints
a framework is needed that can wrap or bundle all these tests and produce a common set of interpretable results. 
  This software, called Pavilion, is such a framework. Many of its underlying ideas come from a prior framework
developed between 2007 and 2013. Lessons learned, new feature requests that the old framework couldn't employ, and adaptable
good ideas are all criteria being used in this new framework.  Two principle ideas that are forefront in the
design are the ability to support schedulers in addition to Moab and a structure that lends itself to team collaboration.
The framework itself does not contain any specific tests, but will be the mechanism for running and then quickly
analyzing the results of any set of incorporated tests.
