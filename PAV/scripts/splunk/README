This directory contains software specific to SPLUNK related work.  Splunk is a commercial product and is
not released as part of Pavilion. In addition, Pavilion can be used without a Splunk infrastructure in place. 

Splunk is a data mining and analysis tool. Splunk expects data in a much different format
than the standard Pavilion output log. The td2splunkData utility will read the job result log file and create
a my.splunkdata file, in the same directory, placing in it native Splunk format records. Basically, a few noteworthy 
values are saved, along with all the trenddata values, and written as key value pairs into this new file.

The td2splunkData script may run at the end of each job, if set to run the in test suite configuration file.
td2splunkData will not overwrite an existing *.splunkdata file.  This allows the test developer, if so inclined,
to generate their own splunk data. The my.splunkdata file is then catenated onto a global data file where Splunk
can be set up to monitor it.

- to see how td2splunkData works:
1) remove the *.splunkdata file from the CWD, if the file exists.
2) run "./td2splunkData <target_log_dir>" (  "." will work if the log file exists in the CWD )
3) a my.splunkdata file is generated in the CWD
